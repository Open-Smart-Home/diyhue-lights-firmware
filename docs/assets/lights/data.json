You need to get access to the pins near the micro-controller as you can see in the images (red-circle). First step is to desoldering away the LEDs PCB from the micro-controller PCB. Now you have to solder flashing wires to the micro-controller PCB. This step is not very easy, due to the PCB cannot be extracted and you have to solder in a very tight space (to make this tutorial I brute-force extracted the PCB and re-solder it with new AC wires, but this operation may destroy the lamp so if you can, avoid it).",
